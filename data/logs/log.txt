All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing RobertaForSequenceClassification.

All the weights of RobertaForSequenceClassification were initialized from the model checkpoint at pysentimiento/bertweet-hate-speech.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use RobertaForSequenceClassification for predictions without further training.

PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).
